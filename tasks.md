> man, if only i had some simplier version of trello to organize these tasks in

## tasks to become usable

- creating thought cards within columns
- drag n drop thought cards between columns

## polish tasks

- empty state on bucket list
- rename bucket on bucket page
- focus the "new thought" input in columns after creating the column

## ideas / nice to have

- search by name
- labels/colors as a colored stripe on the card
- filters by ^
- import from trello
