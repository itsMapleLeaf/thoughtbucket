> man, if only i had some simplier version of trello to organize these tasks in

## tasks for MVP

- dnd reordering columns
- thought editing

## polish tasks

- empty state on bucket list
- rename bucket on bucket page
- focus the "new thought" input in columns after creating the column

## ideas / nice to have

- search by name
- labels/colors as a colored stripe on the card
- filters by ^
- import from trello
- undo?
